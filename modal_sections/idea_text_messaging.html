        <p class="blog">How can we address the problem of the infamous vague text message?
One user exclaimed, “I don’t like the way I sound in my text messages and emails. I wish I had an easier way to format my sentences. People always seem to misunderstand me.”

It’s not a surprising sentement. Why? Probably for many reasons, but there is one reason in particular that I am focusing on currently: becuase text messaging is such a quick form of written communication and lends itself to spontinaeity (much like the spoken word), sending a message prior to proofreading is too easy, and mistakes are often made both in grammar, spelling, sentance structure and clarity of language. It’s fast and on the fly by design. That’s why it’s such a powerful tool that’s been adopted so quickly. As suggested by the already mentioned pitfalls, an inherent problem with text messaging is the communication is subject to high levels of varience and interpretation by the reciever. In every day conversation this is okay because there are many other cues: body language, facial expression, conversive redundencies, and simply asking for clarification. These forms of feedback are completely absent from text messaging. 

More troubling (in the text messaging scenario) is that humans have evolved to make sense of partial information (information with gaps in the logic). In everyday human social scenarios, this helps us make sense of information with unknowns. One example might be a party where two friends get into an argument and one ends up leaving shortly after. It’s fair to conclude that the friend that left so suddenly did so because of the altercation. However, we don’t actually know that. They could have left for any number of reasons. In text messaging scenarios a vague text message is difficult to clarify internally, we don’t have the same level of detail as in the party scenario. More is left to interpretation.  

How can we make text messages more clear in a faster easier way?</p>
