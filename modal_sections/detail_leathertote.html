        <p class="blog">This is a rundown of the process of making a Leather bag - from concept/idea to completion. One thing that's important to note is that with the creation of any product from design to completion the process itself is relatively the same. It's the tools and technologies that change. Good design process is essential to producing great products.</br></br></p>

      <div class="box_caption">
        <p class="blog">Almost every project I ever do starts with a simple sketch. It doesn't matter if the sketch is high or low fidelity. The purpose is to set an indelible vision. Often in a first sketch. a low resolution drawing is better because only the most important product aspects will be apparent in the rendering. The sketch above is probably a fourth or fifth version, which has teased out some of the more salient details.</br></br></p>

      <div class="box_caption">
         <p class="blog">After a sketch is completed I move onto making mockups. The bags in the picture above are made of a cheap canvas that can be drawn on easily. Doing this allows for a complete spacial understanding of product features and usability. It also allows for a level of fidelity not really possible in a sketch, to the degree that we can actually start testing the product. Is the bag large enough? Can it hold the things we want? Does it fit over the shoulder comfortably with this length strap and configuration, ect.</p>

      <div class="box_caption">
        <p class="blog">After the basic product shape and form factor is finalized the next phase is to tease out the details. How does the strap mount to the bag? What mechanism should be used as a closure. How is it to be executed? Simply laying out the components helps to answer these questions.</p>

      <div class="box_caption">
        <p class="blog">As the component parts are decided upon. They are each individually patterned, constructed and tested to ensure correct functionality. Even the smallest parts undoubtedly always change at least a couple of times from patterning to finalization.</p>

      <div class="box_caption">
        <p class="blog">After the layout, component testing and mockup phases are complete then it's time to pony up and start patterning. The patterns are only done when the project direction is ready to be fully committed to. It's a little scary when making a product from an expensive material like leather. If anything is messed up there is no way of fixing it without going back to the beginning again. That is sometimes the price of being the designer â€“ it is the designer whose neck is on the line (but this is also part of the fun).</p>

        <p class="blog">Assembly: Without a doubt this is the most exciting part. All the hard work of drawing, designing, testing and patterning finally comes to fruition. It's also the time when you begin to discover places in the process to make things better the next time around.</a></p>

        <p class="blog">Finally the bag is complete. At least this version. This project took about three weeks from design to completion. It was relatively small in scope, but reaffirms the adage that details are everything. Without proper testing and consideration of the various different materials, hardware and methods this bag would never have come out so nice. Based on the success of this one a second bag was commissioned by another customer. See the images below.</br></p>
