        <p class="blog">The photo above is from November of 2015. I was one of a group that studied shoemaking at a workshop in Port Townsend, Washington. As a lifelong craftsman, it was probably one of the most gratifying experiences I've ever had. Shoe making is an incredibly analog and ancient process. Before taking the workshop, it was utterly mysterious to me, and now I realize how truly utterly mysterious it is. The photos in this post come from several projects and serve to illustrate the overall process of shoe making.</br></p>

        <p class="blog">Like all design work it begins with a simple sketch. Shoes are made on lasts - a mold representing the human foot, which the leather is stretched around to make the form of the shoe. The pattern is drawn directly onto masking tape that's adhered to the last. The drawing on the tape is cut around with a scalpel knife and transfered to a flat sheet of paper. This is the basic technique of patterning a shoe.</br></br></p>
