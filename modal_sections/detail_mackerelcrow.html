        <p class="blog">I had been using the same backpack for about a year. It was a pretty expensive pack $200+ from a particular scandinavian brand. I was not very happy with the usability of it though. It was hard to get in and out of and not that comfortable. But it looked great. Mackerelcrow started out as some simple pencil sketches of a bagpack I envisioned.</br></br></p>

         <p class="blog">I didn't know how to sew. But, I figured it out enough to make an extremely crude mockup. I took the mockup to some professionals and produced a few prototypes. It was an excellent experience. Although, I was paying for the service of having prototypes produced. I ended up learning about the intricacies of product development. </p>

        <p class="blog">To make the brand even more authentic, I hired my graphic designer friend to produce a logo and woven labels. The original brand name was Mackerel and Crow. Named after two of my favorite animals. Mackerel for how tasty it is. Crows for how playful they are. James decided to marry them into one animal, the mackerelcrow. I loved it.</p>
