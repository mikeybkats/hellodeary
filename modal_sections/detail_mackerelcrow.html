        <ul class="blog">
          <li class="blog">The document object model, and how Javascript interacts with it.</li>
          <li class="blog">How to use a version control system like git.</li>
          <li class="blog">How to collaborate with other developers by pair programming.</li>
          <li class="blog">Using the command line.</li>
          <li class="blog">Copious amounts of Javascript.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="blog">It was a great introduction to code for me. I feel that they did a an excellent job at drilling our whole class on the foundational skills. All in all, we completed four to five projects: <a class="blog" href="https://mikeybkats.github.io/H2/" target="_new">A final project of our own devise</a></p>
